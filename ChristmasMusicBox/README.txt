Application name: Christmas Music Box

Current Version: 1.0 (2013-01-04)

Description: A simple Arduino program that mimicks a Christmas card / music box with switchable melody and light sequences.

Used equipment:
  - Arduino UNO R3
  - TinkerKit
  - 3 TinkerKit LED modules
  - 2 TinkerKit Touch Sensor modules (instead of Buttons)
  - 8-ohm speaker (connected to digital pin 8 with 100-ohm resistor)
    
TO-DO List:
  - Either fix tempo arrays or implement a better tempo setting method, because the present tempo is unsatisfactory
  - Add the possibility of inserting pauses between notes
  - Add more melodies and light sequences
